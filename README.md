# SSSM-GBP1-EM
A switching state-space model of motor adaptation. 

State inference is performed using the generalised pseudo-Bayesian 1 (GPB1) algorithm. Parameter learning is implemented via online expectation-maximisation (EM).

Running Run_code.m simulates Experiment 2 of 'Multiple motor memories are learned to control different points on a tool' (Heald et al., Nature Human Behavior, 2018).
