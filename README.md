# SSSM-GBP1-EM
A switching state-space model (SSSM) of motor adaptation. 

The code is set up to simulate Experiment 2 of 'Multiple motor memories are learned to control different points on a tool'.

State inference is implemented using the generalised pseudo-Bayesian 1 (GPB1) algorithm. Cue emission probability parameters are learned via online expectation-maximisation (EM).
