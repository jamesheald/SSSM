# SSSM-GBP1-EM
A switching state-space model of motor adaptation. 

State inference is performed using the generalised pseudo-Bayesian 1 (GPB1) algorithm. Cue emission probability parameters are learned via online expectation-maximisation (EM).

Running the code simulates Experiment 2 of the 'Multiple motor memories are learned to control different points on a tool' (Heald et al., Nature Human Behavior, 2018).
